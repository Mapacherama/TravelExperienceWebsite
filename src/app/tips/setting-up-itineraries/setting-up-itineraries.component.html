  <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 mt-6 text-center">Why Crafting a Detailed Itinerary is Essential</h3>

  <p class="text-lg mb-6 mt-8 mx-auto">
    A well-thought-out itinerary can transform a good trip into an unforgettable journey. It helps you manage your time
    effectively, ensuring that you donâ€™t miss out on the experiences that matter most to you. By planning ahead, you can
    find the best deals on accommodations and transportation, avoid peak tourist times, and discover off-the-beaten-path
    locations.

  <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 mt-6 text-left clear-both">The escape</h3>

  <p class="text-lg mb-6 clear-both">
    Evenings were no different. The digital landscapes of video games became my escape, a place where I could be a hero,
    even if it was just virtual. Alongside the immersive worlds of gaming, movies played a significant role in my
    escapism.
  </p>

  <p class="text-lg mb-6 clear-both">
    The cinematic tales, with their captivating narratives and characters, offered me a temporary respite from my own
    reality. They transported me to different worlds, times, and experiences, allowing me to live vicariously through
    the protagonists.
  </p>

  <p class="text-lg mb-6 clear-both">
    But once the credits rolled and the screen went dark, reality would set back in. I'd find myself aimlessly wandering
    the streets, lost in thought, wondering if this was all life had in store for me.

  <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 mt-6 text-right">Depressing showers</h3>
  <p class="text-lg mb-6">
    At the age of 24, the world outside my window seemed vast and unending, yet my own world felt painfully small. Every morning, as the first rays of sunlight peeked through, I'd already be reaching for my first drink of the day. By 8 AM, the sharp sting of alcohol would course through my veins, numbing the monotony of the life while I was taking the morning shower. I had unwittingly settled into a life I never wanted to be in.

  <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 mt-6 text-center">Dead End Job</h3>

<p class="text-lg mb-6 mt-8 mx-auto">
    My days were defined by the repetitive rhythm of my footsteps as a postman, delivering letters to doorsteps that seemed to hold stories far more exciting than my own. The weight of the mailbag on my shoulder was nothing compared to the weight of the realization that I was trapped in a dead-end job, with no clear direction or purpose.
</p>

<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 mt-6 text-left clear-both">The escape</h3>

<p class="text-lg mb-6 clear-both">
  Evenings were no different. The digital landscapes of video games became my escape, a place where I could be a hero, even if it was just virtual. Alongside the immersive worlds of gaming, movies played a significant role in my escapism.
</p>

<p class="text-lg mb-6 clear-both">
  The cinematic tales, with their captivating narratives and characters, offered me a temporary respite from my own reality. They transported me to different worlds, times, and experiences, allowing me to live vicariously through the protagonists.
</p>

<p class="text-lg mb-6 clear-both">
  But once the credits rolled and the screen went dark, reality would set back in. I'd find myself aimlessly wandering the streets, lost in thought, wondering if this was all life had in store for me.

  <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 mt-6 text-left clear-both">Becoming friends with the darkness</h3>

  <p class="text-lg mb-6">
    Strangely, there was a part of me that was drawn to this darkness. I found a perverse comfort in the depths of despair, almost craving the heavy blanket of depression. Drinking wasn't just an escape; it was a means to sink deeper into that abyss, to willingly drown in the melancholic waves that seemed to resonate with my soul.
  </p>

  <p class="text-lg mb-6">
    Alongside this, I found myself drawn to truly vile and despicable True Crime podcasts. The darker and more depressing the content, the more I sought it out, as if trying to feed the insatiable beast of my own despair.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 mt-6 text-left clear-both">Stagnation and darkness...</h3>

  <p class="text-lg mb-6">
    The vibrant energy of youth that should have propelled me forward was instead being squandered on aimless walks and the cold embrace of the bottle. It was a life of stagnation, where days blended into one another, marked only by the changing seasons and the growing sense of emptiness within.
